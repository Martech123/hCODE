Todo list:
HW developer
 + create a hcode project, init a hcode.spec
 + shell/ip/app and driver folder organize, git
 + upload hcode project to self Github repo, and send a hcode.spec to hFPGA SPEC repo.
 + search hcode projects by any name string, shell/ip/app type, etc.

SW developer
 + create ip and manage a useable folder/project which a given shell.
 + download app, shell, ip and manage a useable folder/project.
 - auto compile ip to hdl.
 - auto compile app, shell, ip to bitstream.
 - auto compile shell driver, ip driver, and prepare java wrapper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the instructions to commit your shell/ip/app to hCODE repo:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create your own github account, for example ipmaker.
2. Visit https://github.com/hCODE-FPGA/Specs and press the fork button. Then you will have a Specs repo in your own github account, https://github.com/ipmaker/Specs.
3. Add your repo for development: 
   $hcode repo add ipmaker https://github.com/ipmaker/Specs
4. Create a SPEC file in your project folder:
   $hcode spec create ip
   Edit the information of the generated hcode.spec file.
   Validate the final hcode.spec file.
   $hcode spec lint hcode.spec
5. Push your hcode.spec to your own repo:
   #hcode repo push ipmaker hcode.spec
6. Send pull request to hCODE master repo at https://github.com/ipmaker/Specs/pulls. And we will evaluate your project and merge your SPEC as soon as possible.
